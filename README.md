run:

chmod +x init.sh
./init.sh
```

## What am I doing?
   I am trying to zip all the flags (in raw .bmp, no compression) as strong as possible to grasp how the file can be compressed.
   So, I have the new size if .zip archive and the size of the original .bmp file, and the complexity index would be `new size / org size`.
